          <h1 class="mb-4">Hi, I am Katrin</h1>
          <h2>Person</h2>
          <p class="about__text mb-4">
            I am 36 years old and live in beautiful Switzerland. I have 3 children. We also have a dog named Whisky and
            a cat named Gin. I love to cook and I used to love to go jogging. Nowadays it has become a bit more
            difficult to balance children, animals, household, education and job, so there is not much time left for
            leisure. I like to play online games with my husband and our friends. Since my husband has his own pizza
            oven, we regularly have pizza parties and game nights with our friends at our house.
          </p>
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p class="about__text mb-4">
            My first training was in the medical field, my second training was in the building materials trade as a
            wholesale and export merchant. I didn't have much contact to the IT area except for the MMORPG I played. I
            even met my husband through one of these games. <br />
            He worked as a software developer in a small company in Switzerland. By luck I lost my job during the
            pandemic and dived into the world of programming. <br />
            My husband used to say he was rebuilding his development environment (IDE) - I thought he was rebuilding his
            office. <br />
            Today I work with him in the small IT company in Switzerland as a web developer.
          </p>
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            One of my big goals is to start my own business with my husband. We are working hard towards this goal and I
            am learning more and more every day so that we can get closer to our goal. After all, what could be better
            than being your own boss? One of my other goals is to go jogging again and learn mindfulness. When I jog, I
            can sort out my thoughts and become calm and think clearly. Something like that is very important in today's
            fast-paced world.
